# 1. Introduction
<p> This interpreter serves as a bridge between rule declarations written in YAML format and executable Python code within OpExpert. It supports five fundamental operations crucial for setting rules within the OpExpert environment: Condition, Execution, Function, Integration, and Module. Each operation corresponds to a specific aspect of rule definition and execution.

- Condition: Specifies the conditions under which a rule should be triggered or applied.
- Execution: Defines the actions or tasks to be executed when a rule's conditions are met.
- Function: Allows users to define custom functions or methods to be used within rule execution.
- Integration: Facilitates the integration of external services or systems into rule execution.
- Module: Enables the organization and modularization of rule components for better management and reusability. </p>

<p> Section 3 of this documentation provides detailed instructions on how to format the YAML file correctly to define rules using these supported operations. By adhering to the specified format, users can seamlessly translate their rule definitions from YAML into Python code, ensuring compatibility and effectiveness within the OpExpert environment. </p>
